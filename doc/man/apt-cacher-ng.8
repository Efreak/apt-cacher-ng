.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Apt-Cacher NG is a caching proxy for software packages which are downloaded by Unix/Linux system distribution mechanisms from mirror servers accessible via HTTP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The command-line options supported by \fBapt-cacher-ng\fP are:
.IP "\fB-c\fP \fIconfdir\fP"
Scan the specified configuration directory and interpret configuration files find there.
.IP "\fB-h\fP"
Short option summary
.IP "\fIvarname=varopt\fP"
The options from the configuration can be passed on the command line as key=value pairs.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
Apt-Cacher NG is configured by a multi-config directory, i.e. the configuration is split into many configuration files having names with suffix \fI.conf\fP and stored in a single directory. Variables can override previously configured settings from other files, sometimes that settings are merged (depending on the variable).
.PP
The configuration directory is typically \fI/etc/apt-cacher-ng\fP but it can be adjusted with the -C option (see systemd service file for details or wherever the init system starts the daemon).
.PP
On Debian systems, there are at least three files installed by default: acng.conf (containing documented examples), security.conf (containing sensible data and only readable for special users) and zz_debconf.conf (containing popular settings which are set by the Debian Configuration mechanism).
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
Only few signals are handled in non-default ways.
.PP
\fBSIGUSR1\fP closes and reopens log files.
.PP
\fBSIGTERM\fP and \fBSIGINT\fP close log files and stop the daemon.
.SH "MORE INFORMATION"
.PP
For more information on Apt-Cacher NG, read the User Manual which can be found either in the doc/pdf directory of the software source package or installed in the documentation directory of apt-cacher-ng by your distribution.
