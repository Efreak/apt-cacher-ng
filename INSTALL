Requirements:

 - Linux or mostly POSIX.1-2001 compliant environment
 - CMake 3.1 or newer, probably also GNU make
 - gcc 4.7 or newer or clang 3.0 or newer and latest libstdc++ or Boost headers
 - on Linux systems, kernel 2.6.22 or newer and glibc 2.8 or newer
 - pkg-config and zlib (and development components)

Extra requirements for optional features:
 - libbz2, liblzma (from XZ), OpenSSL (>= 1.0.2) and their development parts
 - LibTomCrypt can serve as replacement for some parts of functionality if
   OpenSSL is not available. See LibTomCrypt notes below!
 - recent FUSE library and its development files for the "virtual mirror"
   filesystem

Build and installation instructions:

CMake is used internally for build control. It can be run in the source
directory and provides the usual configuration options. However, the
recommended way are out-of-source builds in a subdirectory like build/ that can
be removed to restart from scratch.  There are two convenience scripts that
automate this, build.sh and distclean.sh.
Workflow example:
 - run ./build.sh to configure and build (extra options are passed as cmake
   arguments, build results go to the builddir/ directory)
 - run "make -C builddir install" (maybe with DESTDIR=/tmp/somewhere/else)

Troubleshooting and integrator notes:
 - on configuration problems or to change cached settings afterwards, remove the
   builddir directory or just builddir/CMakeCache.txt in easy cases
 - the build system makes use of pkg-config to locate required software
   components. For locally built packages, you might need to adjust its
   path settings; see manpage for details.
 - Link Time Optimization may be broken with some compilers. If a GCC "internal
   compiler error" appears, first try -DUSE_LTO=off. Some installations also
   have a broken GNU linker, disabling LTO or installing gold (and restarting
   build process) might be advisable.
 - CMAKE_INSTALL_... type of variables is used for most of the target directory
   resolution, see
   https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html for details
 - -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=... specificies main directory to install (/usr/local
   is default)
 - -DCFGDIR=... for custom config directory, default is apt-cacher-ng under
   CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR)
 - -DLIBDIR=... for directory with utilities and supplementary files, default
   is lib/apt-cacher-ng under $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
 - see CMakeLists.txt for more variables that can be customized
 - NOTE: install halibut tool to rebuild the documentation, if needed
 - If an update of remote mirror data is required, this can be achieved with
   "make -C dbgen". The result ends in dbgen/conf/ and needs to be checked
   carefully before installing it because of the evolution of mirrors (the
   scripts might not keep up with the remote changes).

Configure to run on system startup:

This part heavily depends on the used init system.
 - For systemd configuration, the build process creates a service file and
   tmpfiles conf file in builddir/systemd directory. Their contents match the
   detected configuration. They need to be installed manually in the relevant
   folders (see systemd.unit(5), systemd-tmpfiles(8) and tmpfiles.d(5)
   manpages). Then, a local system user called "apt-cacher-ng" and the
   "apt-cacher-ng" group (with the new user therein) needs to be created, and
   new service is enabled with "systemctl enable apt-cacher-ng".
 - For sysvinit, see latest Debian package for examples (unpack with ar/tar or
   just mc).

Configuration:

 - create a directory for cached files and for log files
 - set ownership and directory permissions in a way which allows 
   read/write/mkdir actions to the user account used to run apt-cacher-ng later
 - copy conf directory to /etc/apt-cacher-ng or similar location. 
 - adapt acng.conf and other *.conf files in that configuration directory. 
   See user manual (doc/apt-cacher-ng.pdf or doc/README) for instructions.
 - run apt-cacher-ng -c yourConfigurationDirectory
 - visit Command-and-Control web interface of apt-cacher-ng, link can be found
   among other instructions at http://yourHostName:portNumber/ , which might be
   http://localhost:3142/ with the default configuration
 - for apt clients, there is a config snippet in contrib/10-apt-cacher-ng.conf
   which might be installed into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/.

Developer notes:

There are some macros and shortcuts:
 - scripts/Makefile.release has some test and release rules, one could also run
   "make -f scripts/Makefile.release gendbs" to update built-in mirror
   configuration files
 - DEBUG argument of build.sh adds more verbosity and implicitly sets compiler
   defaults to produce debuggable binaries
 - -DDEBUG (set by above) to enable verbose debug logging. BE WARNED: this
   spams a lot and makes logs explode.
 - Certain environment variables influence cmake, like CXX (compiler to use),
   CXXFLAGS (compiler options, buid.sh won't set cmake defaults if this is
   set), LDFLAGS (compiler flags for linking)

LibTomCrypt notes:

 - LibTomCrypt does not have to be installed system-wide. It's sufficient to
   compile it as static library and set the environment variable TOMCRYPT_HOME
   pointing to LibTomCrypt's source directory
 - with the clang compiler, recent versions of LibTomCrypt might fail to build
   because of internal optimizations not understood by clang. The workaround
   for this is exporting the compiler definition -DLTC_NO_ROLC via CFLAGS
