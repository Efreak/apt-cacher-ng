    erroneously reported as download problems although recovery from this
    state was possible and expected by related code (Debian bug#717832)

  * FIX: HTML syntax in maintenance log and better readability in browser or
    pure text editor
  * FIX: Overhaul of background cleanup scheduler, now spending less CPU time
    with unrelated tasks, preventing infinite loops even if the processing
    code calculated its timing wrong. Minor code fixes on places that might

    target hosts (Debian bug #672801), also sleeping a while before
    reconnecting and extra handling for unexpected EAGAINs
  * FIX: not attempting a download on idle file items (causing misleading
    error messages, Debian bug #672801 second part)
  * FIX: Prevent endless looping on certain download problems (Ubuntu
    bug 999915)
