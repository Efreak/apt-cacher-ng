apt-cacher-ng (3.3) THE-CLAMPS-ARE-MARCHING; urgency=low

  [ POSSIBLY BREAKING CHANGES ]
  * the setting of cachedir and logdir in the built-in defaults is now
    configurable at build time (-DACNG_CACHE_DIR=... -DACNG_LOG_DIR=...)
    and this settings are also propagated into generated configuration examples
  * Dropping support for CMake prior to v3.1, dropped most custom variables
    for target locations, now relying on public CMake variables from
    GNUInstallDirs module; for details, see
    https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.2/module/GNUInstallDirs.html
  * Dropping support for OpenSSL before 1.0.2

  [ FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS ]
  * Change of default network timeout to 40 seconds
  * Alternative fallback scheme for non-primary target connection attempts
    (with default timeout value of 4s, see FastTimeout setting). By default,
    this should help with unstable (blocking) IPv6 routing where IPv4 is still
    operational (Debian bug #942122)
  * Refactored DNS resolution&caching code, potential fix of rate connection
    problems
  * RequiresMountsFor directive in systemd service file example with
    additional remarks on keeping this in sync with the config (as in Debian
    bug #929035 and partly suggested in #942355)
  * PFilePattern extensions for Fedora 29 and 30, by Alan Jenkins, Debian
    bug #928270 (thanks!)
  * added very explicit explanation on what "default value" means in the
    acng.conf example (Debian bug #855995) and also how to print it
    (with acngtool, Debian bug #914746)
  * Mirror database update
  * Configurable timeout for forced client disconnect on the last portion of
    data

  [ BUGFIXES ]
  * increased size of the decompression line buffer for config file reading
    (Debian bug #942634)
  * fixes potential data race in DNS resolution
  * Typo in INSTALL file (Debian bug #913593)
  * In Arch Linux database mirror list, rewrite https URLs to http since the
    official JSON query only returns https versions, also add a different
    source (from Debian bug #942844)
  * Generation of Sourceforge mirror redirectors list is fixed
  * Fixed an ancient bug where there last answered request might have been
    delayed in processing due to incorrect selection of MSG_MORE flag
  * Potential crash on shutdown prevented (misordered destructor sequence)

  [ INTERNAL REFACTORING ]
  * Overhauling code deployment, using a shared library (reducing installed
    file size by up to 20%)
  * dropped rfc2553emu code from old APT, using the platform abstraction from
    libevent instead
  * partial redesign for more singlethreaded IO operation
  * Disabled LTO by default, still crashing gold linker with certain option
    combinations
  * Moved lingering on CLOSE_WAIT sockets to the single main thread

apt-cacher-ng (3.2) MY-NAME-IS-ANYBODY; urgency=medium

  * Maintenance release
  * Basic support for FlatPak repositories
  * Added flat by-hash structure to file patterns
  * Allowing some Debian and Ubuntu services in default PassThroughPattern
  * Various fixes in manpage and configuration examples
  * Mirror database update

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Fri, 07 Sep 2018 12:55:46 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (3.1) SPACE-COWBOYS-FOREVER; urgency=low

  * Hide credentials in acngtool in some corner cases (by astian)
  * Dropped references to distkill.pl script which was superseeded by acngtool
  * Made default PassThroughPattern setting (bugs.d.o) stricter
  * Mirror database update

  [ Carlos Maddela ]
  * Avoid expiration failure when some index files are missing

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sun, 05 Nov 2017 20:28:09 +0100

apt-cacher-ng (3) THIS-IS-NOT-THE-END; urgency=medium

  * NOTE: this release tackles multiple issues that might be considered
    security related in certain environments.
  * FIX: Making sure to truncate the file in case its download is aborted.
    This is needed in order to avoid hidden filesystem space allocation
    (Debian bug #856635). Also more delicate use of fallocate calls on Linux
    due to the potentially syscall execution delay. By default, limit the
    requested size to the first megabyte of a file.
  * FIX: detection of incorrectly allocated files and automated trimming in
    expiration run
  * FIX: acngtool shrink function now uses allocated space for calculation,
    not the visible size. Also more user friendly verbose output and little
    performance optimization.
  * FIX: acngtool shrink function now also considers unknown files as junk
  * FIX: compilation with GCC7, also warning fixes with Clang4
  * FIX: better checking of possibly invalid remote certificate configuration
    in SSL client code
  * FIX: added workaround code for OpenSSL certificate validation even with
    ancient SSL versions like the one found in Ubuntu 14 LTS; borrowed from
    libevent examples (originally from ssl-conservatory and cURL)
  * FIX: no printing of requested file name in the 403 HTTP status line
  * FIX: typo/wording in manual, iptables examples
  * FIX: in file truncation wizard (cleanup task), don't truncate the
    associated .head files (because they might contain the best download
    source information)
  * NEW: better index deletion wizard, offering to remove all related files in
    the same run. This can help to avoid accidental recreation of "incomplete"
    files later.
  * Database update

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Mar 2017 16:23:20 +0100

apt-cacher-ng (2) THE-LAST-JOB-FILMS-LTD; urgency=medium

  * Minor refactoring (DNS cache with fewer mutexes)
  * FIX: communication for maint jobs now properly considers possible
    addresses from daemon's configuration. Communication via UDS remains
    broken which is subject to repairs in the next update of core code
  * FIX: Correct parsing of unix suffixes for ExStartTradeOff option
  * FIX: fixes for compilation errors with GCC 5.4 (by Bob Ham)
  * FIX: try to link with libatomic, some architectures require it

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Nov 2016 21:29:54 +0100

apt-cacher-ng (1) LOGAN-VS-BLADE-RUNNER-3D; urgency=low

  * The version numbers change to plain integer. The minor numbers were
    already hardly used for differentiation between bugfix and feature
    releases. If this becomes ever needed, the version might be extended to
    x.y scheme.
  * FIX: typo in option name ExThreshold, and also hiding obsolete options
    in configuration dump
  * FIX: correct display of errors in acngtool curl operation
  * FIX: strict SSL hostname validation even with peers not supporting SNI
    (Debian bug #839751)
  * NEW: simple "live" download statistics display on the maintenance page
  * NEW: storage of simple download statistics across service restart (until
    the expiration run)
  * NEW: default method to abort expiration runs if not much data has been
    downloaded though the proxy since the last expiration run.
  * NEW: special command in acngtool ("shrink") to files until
    the wanted size of the cache directory is reached (considering file type
    and creation dates). The default strategy is keeping least recently
    downloaded files in cache.
  * NEW: optional tagging of used package files which can influence the
    "shrink" command operation to keep least recently USED files instead of
    least recently downloaded files.
  * CHANGE: remote errors now printed as E states in the logging code
  * Database update

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Oct 2016 22:07:06 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.9.3.2) PAINT-IT-AEROGLAZE-Z306; urgency=low

  * FIX: avoid endless looping on startup when a new (not existing) directory
    was specified as CacheDir
  * FIX: build failure on non-Linux POSIX systems (Debian bug #830736, now
    moved namespace tag to general scope)
  * FIX: Stop printing bogus "error" summary on the end of every maintenance
    task execution
  * NEW: allow for omission of CacheDir setting; continues operation in
    degraded mode with only harmless features which are not needing local
    storage (HTTPS pass-through, local web server)
  * Mirror database update

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Jul 2016 21:56:15 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.9.3.1) KLENDATHU-AIRLINES-FLIGHT-931; urgency=low

  * This is a minor bugfix release, there are more changes to expect soon
  * FIX: attaching to monitor the output of background maintenance task in the
    browser working properly
  * Extended workaround for the fake Content-Location "redirect", setting
    "Accept: octet/stream" header which seems to be the only way to tell
    Apache and nginx that we really want THAT data and not some compressed
    version (no matter whether it's gzip or xz or cewwlCrzyCompression3000 or
    whatever their authors consider suitable for everybody by default)
  * Better handling of error situations in expiration task, printing a summary
    at the bottom.
  * extended metadata (changelogs) download filters for Tanglu
  * Added documentation on how to use multilines with RequestAppendix option

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Wed, 08 Jun 2016 23:07:52 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.9.3) HAVE-SOME-LIGHT-BALLS; urgency=medium

  * FIX: Cope with removal of SHA1 checksums from Debian/Ubuntu (In)Release files
  * FIX: Overhaul of pdiff based update code, actually repairing pdiff code in
    some environments which has been silently broken for about 2-3 months.  The
    old code was designed for the situation a half decade ago when
    information like compressed version's checksum was not available in the
    patch index.
  * FIX: reduction of volatile data whitelist - now expiring deprecated
    Translations*/* data
  * Small review of expiration (index file updating) code, replaced some
    cruft to make analysis with less syscalls and attempt to get more likely
    available of remote files in some cases.
  * Better handling of by-hash type files:
    + Moved internal storage of Release files' tracking snapshots to a private
      namespace of the cache
    + Proper detection of caches where by-hash data has been downloaded by
      previous versions without tracking snapshots and work around this
      situation
    + in case that by-hash directory has a better version of the reference
      file (matching the latest InRelease's signature), the reference file
      contents is replaced with that correct version
    + correct handling for expiration with or without strict path checking
  * WORKAROUND:
    + detecting a situation when remote attempts to foist uncompressed version
      on the proxy and returning a 500 code to user instead; otherwise that data
      would be handled incorrectly and eventually poison the cache

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sun, 29 May 2016 18:34:45 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.9.2) HERE-COMES-JASON; urgency=medium

  * Added regexps for Debian, by-hash index files and changelog data on
    ftp-master.debian.org
  * FIX: expiration of orphaned Packages.bz2 (and similar) files in
    Debian/Ubuntu repositories
  * Added deb.debian.conf to Debian mirror list (Debian bug #820813)
  * Database update
  * Enabling LTO on GCC 5+ as default (working around suspected pthread issues
    by switching to std classes instead of custom pthread access), also fixing
    some GCC 6 specific warnings
  * FIX: default regex for .asc suffix, for Debian's new source files' PGP
    signatures, since dpkg-dev 1.18.5
  * FIX: parse option suffixes with hypens (like Remap-x-y) correctly
  * FIX: on systems where volatile files are accessed ONLY through files named
    by hash value (actually only Ubuntu Xenial),
    attempt to extract the original file names from seen InRelease files and
    restore tracking of original files.
    This is a stop-gap solution (and there will better integration of
    Acquire-By-Hash feature in future releases) but it's needed to be
    deployed ASAP to avoid cache damages on existing systems.

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Fri, 13 May 2016 19:37:53 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.9.1) THE-DARK-NIGHT; urgency=low

  * FIX: corrected linking on systems that need additional libraries to be
    linked manually for socket IO while libwrap was not available
  * More file pattern changes for Ubuntu's do-release-upgrade tool
  * Better processing of filename sets in the "deletion" wizard (compressed
    parameter exchange for longer lists)
  * Database update

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Feb 2016 17:17:43 +0100

apt-cacher-ng (0.9.0) MAXIMUM-OVERDRIVE; urgency=low

  * FIX: Ubuntu Installer's ReleaseNotes fetching was interpreted incorrectly
    forced redirection of ISP to its auth page. Now keeping the target page
    in doubt, just making sure it's reloaded next time.
  * More volatile regexp's to cover requests from Ubuntu Installer, including
    the link that it uses to examine state of the network connection
  * FIX: Replaced "unofficial" uint type with unsigned (should resolve build
    problems under FreeBSDs)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Feb 2016 19:48:10 +0100

  [ Eric Vander Weele ]
  * Fix for Alioth issue #315276 (explicit return type declaration in a
    lambda, for a build failure with clang 3.5)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jan 2016 20:21:59 +0100

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.8) CTHULHU-IS-CALLING; urgency=medium

  * Added support for AppStream metadata in Debian
  * Added filename regexps for FreeBSD files (no expiration code yet)
  * Updated documentation to refer to acngtool instead of expire-caller.pl
  * FIX: check-all checkbox in cleanup assistant functionality, and minor HTML
    format fixes
  * Refactored setting of complex option, added their printing with acngtool

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Dec 2015 14:21:58 +0100

  * DB generator improvements (parallelization or mirror probing using xargs)
  * added Ubuntu distupgrader release notes to volatile files pattern until
    better information is available
  * Database update
  * More useful reporting of outgoing connection mode on debug verbosity level
  * On GNU toolchain, reduce the size of acngtool and acngfs binaries with
    *sections* options set
  * Option to detect (and turn off) an unreachable upstream proxy through a
    custom shell command
  * Build system changes to really check linker flags in linker calls (fixing
    build on OS-X) and to build faster (just share code between build targets)
  * Option to build without LibTomCrypt (with reduced functionality) or with
    statically linked LibTomCrypt without having to install it first
  * More usefull error messages from acngtool's HTTP downloader
  [ Christoph Biedl <debian.axhn@manchmal.in-ulm.de> ]
  * Fix computation of download limit

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.6) LITTLE-STEP-FOR-A-BIT; urgency=low

  * Build system overhaul, splitted CMakeLists.txt per target, added install
    rules, updated build documentation
  * FIX: enabled SNI feature (TLS Server Name Indication)
  * If OpenSSL is not available, use LibTomCrypt for hash algorithms. Dropped
    included sha1/sha2/md5 implementations.
  * FIX: smarter switching between InRelease and Release file versions in
    expiration runs, triggered by a 404
  * FIX: added auto-skipping of failing proxy to also for tunnel construction
    (https proxying, bugs.debian.org SOAP, etc.)
  * FIX: disabled LTO again, sometimes runtime errors with GCC5
  * NEW: moved the expiration caller script functionality to acngtool and made
    it less verbose for better use in cron jobs
  * FIX: code mistake in Darwin specific parts. Plus, the new LD flags checks
    should also cover the wrong --as-needed check (Alioth task #315130)
  * FIX: in expiration, force blacklisting of .head files without related
    content, even for index files like deprecated Packages.bz2/Sources.bz2
  * More automatic index file replacements (Sources/Packages gz to xz,
    InRelease to Release and vice versa)
  * Removed timestamps from generated gzip files
  * Added Ubuntu's mirror.txt to whitelist (no point in removing it)
  * Database update (and fixed update of gentoo_mirrors.gz)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Sep 2015 21:32:11 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.5) WHERE-NO-VERSION-HAS-GONE-BEFORE; urgency=low

  * FIX: smart reconnection code (for sudden remote disconnects) was not
    working as intended since at least version 0.7.4 (however, this was
    covered by other issues and became visible after recent changes related to
    connection forwarding)
  * FIX: Changed default pipeline depth to 10 for better compatibility with
    stupid middleboxes
  * NEW: Added SHA2 support and for non OpenSSL usage: implementations from
    http://www.ouah.org/ogay/sha2/
  * FIX: expiration code for Cygwin data
    + file entry parsing with SHA512 variants
    + correct resolution of base path, fixing path and checksum verification
    + added setup.bz2 to whitelist
  * FIX: in maintenance task downloads, strip double slashes from remote URLs
    which were added on repo-mapped paths (Debian bug #793356)
  * CHANGE: in configuration parsing (adding contents from linked files), a
    <something>.default file was not considered if <something> file was found
    (even if <something> was unreadable or didn't have useful contents)
  * Database update
  * Added a helper to remove deprecated bz2 versions of index files ASAP

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.4) REVENGE-OF-THE-KLUDGE; urgency=low

  * Code refactoring, little memory consumption improvements
  * FIX: creation of the PID file even in non-forking mode (Debian bug #784752)
  * Moving some functionality not relevant for server operation to a dedicated
    tool called "acngtool"
  * VFilePattern extension, [#314924] Allow access to CentOS images
  * LTO is default option again, removed NOLTO hack (use CMAKEOPTS to disable)

    <felix.janda@posteo.de>)
  * Redirection of plain http POSTs to bugs.debian.org is now always
    redirected to https style URL.

    incorrect parsing in some cases (identical prefix of header name)
  * Added recent Ubuntu release names (vivid, wily) to mirror checker
  * NEW: when uncached operation is active (DontCache* options), most custom
    headers are passed to the remote servers (Alioth task 314773)
  * Mirror database update

    if an extra proxy is configured
  * FIX: correct detection and blacklisting of broken (permanently
    disconnecting) hosts
  * NEW: options to run a command upon SIGBUS and disable SSL checks
  * Creating fresh connection for each bugs.d.o operation (attempt to fix
    Debian bug #775126)
  * Various fixes and workarounds for pass-through operations in proxy
    cascades, for direct connects (HTTPS tunnels) and bugs.debian.org SOAP

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.0) GOOD-ENOUGH; urgency=low

  * Work around damaged cache contents when retrieving index files in
    maintenance tasks (Debian bug #737069)
  * Cosmetic changes

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 2014 22:39:17 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.0rc4) BETA; urgency=low

  * Using eventfd only on Linux
  * Portability fixes for kFreeBSD and Windows (Cygwin)
  * For static generated content respones, make sure to send the EOF chunk
    before closing connection (Debian Bug #762969)
  * Maintenance page related:
    + Cosmetic fixes
    + Fix enforced download on aggregated repos without backend spec (now
      really considering the download URL even from inconsistent header files)
    + Added proper reconstruction of URL for enforced downloads relatively
      to the associated .diff/Index file
    + Fixed some undefined behavior in volatile file refreshing, improved some
      "optimistic" code
  * Reenabled use of LTO (opt-out now with NOLTO=1 flag)
  * Fixed explicite download error hiding

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Fri, 03 Oct 2014 23:55:02 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.0rc3) BETA; urgency=low

  * Remove some forgotten debug printing which interfered with option parsing

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Sep 2014 12:40:56 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.0rc2) BETA; urgency=low

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Sep 2014 12:14:26 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.0rc1) BETA; urgency=low

  * Systemd changes: sd_notify integration if libsystemd-daemon is available.
    Service file now can act more precisely if Type is set to notify. Minor
    tmpfiles config tuning to survive bad permission changes, obsoleting the
    ExecStartPre command.
  * Alternative to download thread wake via pipe with eventfd on Linux systems
    (needs less file descriptors)
  * Config file lookup code change to found .default files scattered between
    config and support-data folders
  * Fix false positive of the bad-auth-page-redirection detector, triggering
    on multiple redirects with some HTML content (Sourceforge scheme). Also
    allowed ?&= to be sent unencoded since some server's don't decode the
    escaped version correctly.
  * Keep some information in cached headers while reseting the file state
    (needed to retrive original URL for maintenance tasks)
  * Rereading disk information in advanced file checks (maintenance), cache
    cannot be trusted and keeping it fresh is not worth the efforts
  * Fixed HTTP redirection with backend mode
  * Maintenance download code now prefers the original path resolved by
    backend consideration if that option looks more likely
  * Internal refactoring WRT download job management
  * Fixed Base64 encoding to work correctly with non-ascii characters (still
    not recommended, better use URL encoding in password settings!)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Sep 2014 10:51:05 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.0~pre3) BETA; urgency=low

  * Special handling for a case where no volatile (meta) data is present in
    the cache in its original version but the pdiff patches are there. The
    guessed best version of the base file is fetched automatically.
  * Internal refactoring, replacement of GCC specific atomic operations in
    debug code
  * FIX: potential bottleneck (serialization of connect operations because of
    too big critical section)
  * FIX: SSL_connect now running on non-blocking file handle with timeout,
    hopefully avoiding the sometimes happening freezing for hours
  * Database update

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Tue, 09 Sep 2014 22:52:32 +0200

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.0~pre2) ALPHA; urgency=low

  * Fixed Tracing mode in non-debug build
  * Added NEWS.Debian to the volatile patterns filter (LP: #1350432)
  * FIX: premature release of internal file descriptors sometimes causing
    pointless reconnects (thanks to Kirill Timofeev)
  * FIX: rare case of premature abortion of a chunked transfer if the source
    deliveres data to slowly
  * Added a trick to allow silent handling of arbitrary range requests in a
    more appropriate way (returning 206) within a limited defined period
    (configured through MaxInresponsiveDlSize variable; Debian bug #744727)
  * Stopped using encoded URL strings in the internal processing (pointless
    code compilications)
  * Added support for more formats of the Location: URL in redirects
  * Refactoring of old file item maintaining code
  * Partial workaround for transparent redirects to WiFi auth sites etc.

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Aug 2014 21:33:14 -0700

apt-cacher-ng (0.8.0~pre1) ALPHA; urgency=low

  * Better reporting of error messages in config file reader (Alioth
    task 314684)
  * Source tree cleanup, moving to git
  * Database update
  * overall code review and refactoring with C++11 features, now requiring
    language feature support of GCC 4.7 or newer or equivalent Clang compiler
  * Admin helper tool for identification of required filename pattern changes
  * Additional pattern options that extend the current ones, allowing to user
    to add custom configuration without interference with future updates of
    default settings
  * Special file name pattern set which identifies static files before
    name is checked against volatile file pattern. The feature is now used to
    identify special .gpg files that are static while volatile rule matches
    all others .gpg files (Debian bug 720165)
  * Partial rewrite of internal web page creation code, new syntax for server
    side includes, with smooth access to configuration options and less
    computational overhead
  * better checks for compiler and linker features
  * CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS variable passing (for optimizations, see INSTALL)
  * Using hash maps/sets on various locations for better performance
  * Portability fixes for systems without zlib or libbz2
  * Lots of refactoring on maintenance page factory code, including bugfix:
    Displaying user info page rather than admin page if the admin page site
    name was not configured in the config at all
  * On expiration code, review and partial rewrite:
    + better readability and performance

    + contents checking for Debian Installer image indexes, no more carte
      blanche for d-i files unless one adds them manually to the whitelist
    + better checking file sizes inconsistencies without checksumming

  * Additional care about never truncating files while they might be still
    open in the maintenance tasks
  * Rudimentary handling of SIGBUS; only user notification with guessed
    trouble source (mmap'ed file) in error log and gracefull exit
  * If OpenSSL is available, use libcrypto implementation of SHA1 and MD5
    hashing (much faster on modern CPUs)

    erroneously reported as download problems although recovery from this
    state was possible and expected by related code (Debian bug#717832)

  * FIX: HTML syntax in maintenance log and better readability in browser or
    pure text editor
  * FIX: Overhaul of background cleanup scheduler, now spending less CPU time

    target hosts (Debian bug #672801), also sleeping a while before
    reconnecting and extra handling for unexpected EAGAINs
  * FIX: not attempting a download on idle file items (causing misleading
    error messages, Debian bug #672801 second part)
  * FIX: Prevent endless looping on certain download problems (Ubuntu
    bug 999915)
