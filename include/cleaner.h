/**
 * @brief Primitive task scheduler for internal helper functions
 *
 * It's based on few assumptions: a) called methods are static,
 * b) called method return the next time they want to be called
 * c) called method can be run at any time without side-effects
 * (they have to check the need of their internal work by themselves)
 *
 * The implementation comes from a trade-off. Data size is not big enough to justify use of priority_queue,
 * and it also makes not much sense since time points need to be adjusted for specific usecases without
 * need to invalidate previous entries sitting in the prio-queue.
